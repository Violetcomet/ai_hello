## üöÄ How to Use in Notion (Setup Guide)

To embed this interactive AI chat widget into your Notion page, follow these steps:

1.  **Host Your `index.html` File:**
    * The easiest way is to host your `index.html` file (containing this code) on **GitHub Pages**.
    * Create a GitHub repository, upload your `index.html` and your `B·∫ßu tr·ªùi.jpeg` image.
    * Go to your repository settings on GitHub, navigate to "Pages," and set your source to "main" (or your preferred branch) and select the `/ (root)` folder.
    * GitHub Pages will then provide you with a public URL (e.g., `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/`). Make sure your `B·∫ßu tr·ªùi.jpeg` image is also publicly accessible at its corresponding URL within your GitHub Pages site.

2.  **Copy the Public URL:**
    * Once your page is hosted (e.g., on GitHub Pages), copy the full public URL (e.g., `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/`).

3.  **Embed in Notion:**
    * Open your Notion page.
    * Type `/embed` and select the "Embed" block.
    * Paste the public URL you copied in the previous step into the embed block.
    * Click "Embed link."

4.  **Adjust Size:**
    * The widget will appear in your Notion page. You can drag the corners of the embed block to resize it to your preferred width and height, ensuring the chat area is maximized for your view.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

You can easily personalize several aspects of the widget by editing the `index.html` file:

1.  **Your Name:**
    * Change `const userName = "Ishan";` to your desired name (e.g., `"Alice"` or `"Master of Clouds"`). This name is used in the AI's greetings.

2.  **Background Image (`B·∫ßu tr·ªùi.jpeg`):**
    * Locate the `background-image` property in the `<style>` section.
    * Find the `url('https://placehold.co/800x600/D0EEF6/E0F2F7?text=Cloudy+Sky+Background')` part.
    * **Replace this placeholder URL with the direct public URL to your wallpaper image.** If you're using GitHub Pages, it might look something like `url('https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/B·∫ßu%20tr·ªùi.jpeg')` (note: spaces in filenames might be replaced with `%20`).

3.  **Initial Greeting:**
    * Modify the second object in the `chatHistory` array (the one with `role: "model"`) to change the AI's initial greeting.
    * `{ role: "model", parts: [{ text: \`Hello, Master ${userName}! How can I assist you today?\` }] }`

4.  **AI Prompts & Logic:**
    * For advanced customization, you can modify the `callGeminiAPI` function and the prompts used in `generateIdeas`, `liftSpirits`, and `sendMessage` functions to alter the AI's behavior and response style.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the widget.
* **CSS3:** For styling, animations, and responsive design.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For interactive elements, API calls, and animations.
* **Google Gemini API:** Powers the AI chat functionality.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Used for utility-first CSS classes (though mostly custom CSS is used here).
